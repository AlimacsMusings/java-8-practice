# Java 8 Exercises

This project contains exercises to try out Java 8 features.

pm.java8.streams.StreamsExercises is a test suite that demonstrates various ways of generating and using streams. 
It takes the form of JUnit tests that can be run in an IDE or from the command line by running the tests with Gradle

```
gradlew test
```
or
```
./gradlew test
```
The tests each contain a place for a small amount of code to be written to make the test pass, each test exercising a 
few aspects of Java streams. Example solutions are given in pm.java8.streams.StreamsExercisesExampleSolutions. 
There is often more than one way of achieving the same result so I've just given the ones I thought of; if you've 
found a different way, be happy.
